[This program](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/nested-tictactoe/4619394864185344) is a game of nested Tic-Tac-Toe. The rules are the same as normal Tic-Tac-Toe except that each cell is another game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Rather than being able to pick any cell to play it, you are limited based on where the last player moved. If O plays in the top right cell of the top left game, X must play in the top right game for their move.
