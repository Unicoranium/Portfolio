A simple program to draw a tree with random branches. 

I used this tree for a school project.

<iframe id="frame" style="max-width: 100%; width: 1000px; min-height: 563px" src="/src/speakTree.html"></iframe><br />
<button onclick="let frame = document.getElementById('frame'); frame.src = frame.src">Reload</button>
<a href="/src/speakTree.html" target="_blank">Open in new tab</a>

In high school English one year, after we read the book Speak, we were assigned the project of creating something artistic that related to the book. I created this program.

The quotes were taken from the book and were used to create this tree.
