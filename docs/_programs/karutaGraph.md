[Karuta] is a game run through a Discord bot. While I never got much into it, my friends played it quite a bit, so I made a few programs to help them play it. 

[Karuta] is a trading card game. You collect trading cards of various anime characters and decorate the cards to make them look better and have better stats. 

[Karuta] receives constant updates so some of this information may be outdated since I don't play the game.

In [Karuta], there are resources called "bits" which can be used to buy frames to put on your cards. These frames make the card look better as well as improves the stats.

This program creates a bipartite graph for all the frames. Each dark blue node is a resources while each light blue node is a frame. Each frame requires two resources. The point of the graph is to help decide opportunity cost of each frame since the trade value of frames are dependent on public opinion rather than resource cost.
