Takes an input containing roman numerals and calculates the decimal number.

There is no error checking for valid roman numerals here, it will still try to calculate it but the result will be meaningless.

This uses the standard rules for roman numerals. This means it only uses one subtractive form for each symbol. For example, 8 is written as VIII and 9 is written as IX.
