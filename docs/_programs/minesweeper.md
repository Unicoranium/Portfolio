I played Minesweeper once, and I thought it was interesting so I decided to [make it](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/minesweeper/6344173864222720). It has flagging and configurable size and mine count. If you click on a number that has enough flags around it, it will open all the other adjacent tiles. Your first click will never be a mine or even adjacent to one.
