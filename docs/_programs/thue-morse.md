Draws Koch's curve by following the [Thue-Morse Sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thueâ€“Morse_sequence).

The sequence can be derived a few ways, but the way I do it here is just counting the number of 1's in each consecutive binary number.

If the result is odd, move forward, otherwise, rotate by 60 degrees.
