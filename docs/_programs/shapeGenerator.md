[This program](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/shape-generator-regular-shapes-only/5021773089341440) uses the built in vectors to draw convex regular shapes.

Eventually, it evolved into a much more [advanced program](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/button-shape-and-text-creator/4944052113637376). This program can create text, shapes, or functioning buttons from a single object instantiation. It's not the cleanest, since it uses about 27 parameters to create a button, but I made this all the way back in middle school so I didn't know better.

[Another similar program](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/concave-shapes/4827626003890176) I made was able to create concave star shapes.
