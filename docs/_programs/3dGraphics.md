I was getting into 3D graphics and needed something to do with it. My dad's birthday wasn't far off, so I decided to make something for him. 

Fairly self-explanatory, it draws the text "Happy B-Day!" using intentionally misaligned blocks. Only from directly in front can the text be read properly.

Another program I made for 3D graphics was on Khan Academy [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/3d-stuff/6540669782982656). This program can create any of 6 types of objects. Defined in the `objects` array on line 66, the type can be any of the following: "cyl", "cone", "sphere", "cube", "triprism", "slope". The shapes dont always render in the correct order. They render in order of Z for the center of the shape.
