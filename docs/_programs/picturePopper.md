[A simple program](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/picture-popper/5350841276) to draw an image and analyze the pixel data. After gathering the pixel data, it redraws the image with bubbles.

Initially its a single bubble to cover the whole canvas, but by mousing over it, you can pop the bubble.

[Another variation of the same program](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/image-scanner/5293855966) where instead it just draws the entire image with the same size bubble. You can click the image to cycle the size.
