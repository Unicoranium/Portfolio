One of the many pathfinding programs I've made. Most of the other ones I've made were a stepping stone towards this one.

It calculates the path from one tile to another. These tiles are marked with gradients. For all calculations, the "blue" gradient is considered the starting tile.

The gradient tiles can be dragged to new locations and it will recalculate the path. Choices are made randomly if two paths are considered equal.

For any given tile, the top number is its cost. A cost of 0 means unpathable. The bottom number is the total cost to reach that tile.

Left click on a tile to increase its cost. Right click on a tile to decrease its cost.
