This program is meant to simulate a series of teams fighting over territory.

The fullscreen version will prompt you to select a difficulty.

Click anywhere on the canvas to command your troops to move towards that point. Troops will attack nearby enemy troops or colonies. Bringing a colonies health down to 0 will convert it to your color. Killing enemy troops or converting colonies will give you XP. When the XP bar at the top fills up, you get a point you can spend to upgrade one of the three stats.

The gray colonies are neutral and will not attack, but still create troops to defend themselves.
The other colonies are you, the player, and the AI colonies. Each color is a separate AI player that moves their troops and upgrades their stats.

As one of my earlier programs, I had no real concept of good game design and as a result, the balance in this is so awful it's not right to call it a game, so it's a simulation.
